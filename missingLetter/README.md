## Problem Explanation

  * You will create a program that will find the missing letter from a string and add it. 
    If there is not missing letter it will return undefined. There is currently no test case 
    for it missing more than one letter, but if anything recursion can be implemented or a
    second or more calls to the same function as needed. Also the letters are always provided
    in order so there is no need to sort them.
